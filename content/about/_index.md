## About Us

The MilSpace Club is a fresh take on spouse clubs focusing on the Los Angeles Air and Space community. Our efforts for programming are focused on rotating throughout the region, with a heavy emphasis on the El Segundo area as a “center point” - meeting members where they live. Our hope is to create the next chapter of social events and on meeting the culture and tradition needs for the LA space community.

Membership is open to “anyone who has access to LA AFB on their own”. Meaning, if you have a DOD uniform services card you can join. Spouses, Active duty, retirees, contractors, etc. (For those that are significant others, they can attend “open events” at non-member rates).

MilSpace Club events will rotate through the region in different zones, largely reflective of each city or combining a couple together so that we can connect with our members in each different region where they live.

The MilSpace Club will have all member events ranging from annual member events/socials, in which both members, and non-members can attend at separate rates. There will be some events throughout the year that will be “Members only” as an added member benefit.

In addition to all member events, we will be supporting “Special Interest Groups” (SIGs) or Meetups that any member can start (please email [MilSpaceClub@gmail.com](mailto:milspaceclub@gmail.com) to start one!) and have regular meetings around common interests that we will help to promote as a part of the greater club communications.  Special Interest Groups or “SIGs” can range from anything such as Gardening, Volunteering, Moms Play Group, Book Club, Guys Gang, Board Game Club, Bunko, Couponing, Hiking, etc. Members can attend all these groups as a part of their membership benefits. Non-members can attend any two meetings to test out the club before being required to join (And with free membership now through July 31, 2024 - why not join today?!) In the future as the club grows, SIGs will have access to request funding for special projects or events.

Not able to join, or not sure if membership is right for you? (And with free membership now through July 31, 2024 - why not join today?!) Non-members can attend any two SIG Meetups before needing to join the club as a member. **The SIGs of Guy’s Group, Brunch, and Happy Hour will not require membership to join. These specific SIGs will always be open to non-members to attend to help foster community and connections with no membership requirement.**

**Free membership trials extend February 28, 2024 and run through July 31, 2024 - so sign up today!** The new membership year begins August 1, 2024 and runs through May 31, 2025. Membership renewal and dues information will be sent out in July 2024 for those who signed up for their free trial membership with information for the 2024-2025 membership year. Your free trial membership does not obligate you to continue for the new membership year, but allows you to experience the club as we are developing it!

Dues are rank specific and are modeled after other Space Spouse Club dues structures to be inclusive and equitable. Beginning in Fall 2024, dues are listed below by rank.
